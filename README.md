# oSoCalc

*A small personal project that may help some people, companies or even institutions switch to open-source-solutions.*

This website that let's you calculate whether it is worth it to switch to Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solutions and share your results with other people.
A promininent example would be MS Office vs Libreoffice


## How does the calculation work?

We estimate the one-time switching costs such as employee-training expenses, temporary inefficiency due to training, and setup-cost for the new software-solution. These costs will then be added to the yearly expanses such as licence-fees and salaries payed the maintanance-programmers. The results are plotted over the next 20 years.


## How to use the calculator:

Go to the **Price Calculator**-section and input the required costs and amounts. Then click on the button titled "Calculate Financial Results".

It is recommended that you input values conservatively. For example, if you are unsure whether the number of maintanance programmers nedded for the new solution is 2 or 3, go with three. This way, if the results are positive, you can be more confident in their accuracy.

You can share your results (see turquoise button) by either just copying the URL or by sharing the link via email. Make sure to double-check your data before sharing the results.
